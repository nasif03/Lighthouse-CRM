# Lighthouse CRM Backend (placeholder)

This folder will contain the backend service (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) with multi-tenant support. For now, the focus is on the Frontend UI.

Planned:
- Express API with Google auth
- MongoDB with tenant-aware collections
- Clean architecture following SOLID principles
